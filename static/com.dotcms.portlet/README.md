This bundle is an example of how to create and add Portlets for use in the dotCMS administrative console using an OSGI bundle plugin.

This example includes the code to create three different types of Portlets, all of which are supported by dotCMS:

1. Velocity Portlet: a Portlet implementation that will display portlet content using a velocity file
2. Jsp Portlet: a Portlet implementation that will display portlet content using a jsp file
3. Struts Portlet: a Portlet implementation that will call an Struts Action class that will use a jsp file in order to display portlet content.
