This plugin works as an Servlet example of a static plugin. It can be imported to the IDE and use gradle jar tasks to compile the /src folder.For complete deploy process this folder needs to be under /plugins directory of a dotCMS official distribution.

You can add or even override dotCMS servlets and filters. To do so you add your specific filters and servlets to the web-ext.xml. The override happens by keying on the servlet-name for a servlet and the filter-name for the filters.
